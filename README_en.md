## Calendar App README

### Project Overview

This is a simple calendar application that allows users to record daily schedules and summaries. Users can select a date on the calendar, then add morning and afternoon schedules, as well as a summary. Additionally, users can add their own notes within each time slot.

### How to Use

1. Open the calendar app, and you'll see a calendar table displaying a month's worth of dates.

2. Click on a date of interest; it will be highlighted, and the date details will appear on the right side.

3. In the date details, you can perform the following actions:

   - Add morning and afternoon schedules:
     - Click the "Add" button to open a text box where you can input your morning or afternoon schedule.
     - Click the "Save" button to save your schedule.

   - Edit the summary:
     - Input or edit your summary information in the summary text box.

   - Add notes:
     - In the morning or afternoon notes section, click the "Add" button to add your notes.
     - Click the "Delete" button next to each note item to remove a specific note.

4. Your schedules, summaries, and notes will be automatically saved in local storage, so you can revisit the application at any time to view or edit your previous records.
